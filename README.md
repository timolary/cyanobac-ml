# Predicting Cynobacteria Levels using Machine Learning 
----
### Mahalia Clark and Tim Laracy


Cyanobacteria blooms are a major problem in Lake Champlain. Every year in the summer months, populations of these blue-green algae grow to the point where they fill the water with unsightly scum. Even worse, they can produce dangerous toxins that are harmful to swimmers and beach-goers, and which have even killed pet dogs. This forces municipalities to close beaches whenever blooms are sighted, and in the long term has a harmful effect on the local economy, part of which is driven by seasonal lake tourism. Toxic blooms can also impact municipal drinking water, since Burlington, VT and other lake-side towns draw their water from Lake Champlain.

We have applied a variety of machine learning methods to a unique, public, long-term data set produced by the VT Department of Environmental Conservation. We analyze ten years of data on water quality and cyanobacteria levels from around Lake Champlain with the goal of predicting cyanobacteria levels from easily measured water quality indicators.
